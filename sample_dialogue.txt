<NoTag>                    You reach into the void.
                           Suddenly, a voice calls out to you.






<the voice>       Whenever the person speaking changes, you must use angle brackets to specify.

<the voice>       It is okay if you put the same person in the angle brackets, 
                           it will not affect the dialogue system

<the voice>       If for some reason, you need to use angle brackets within your <dialogue>...
                           you must respecify the character in that line.


                           Please try to keep each line relatively short.
If it doesn't fit in the dialogue box, it will get cut off. For example, since I'm cramming two sentences onto this line, it will most likely get cut off.

                           effects are done [rainbow]like so![/rainbow] Isn't that great!
