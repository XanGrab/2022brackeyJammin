<Old man>  Oh hello! What are you doing here?
           What am I doing here? I live here silly!
           Oh the door?
Well,\.\. everyone knows you shouldn’t open doors in a dream silly!
Well, actually this is a video game. Who am I talking to? Not you!
Ok well, I want you to try and imagine something called an 'R' key.
(No!\.\. not you! Do you see any buttons for you to press?)
Hitting that should allow you to leave this room and wake from your dream.
