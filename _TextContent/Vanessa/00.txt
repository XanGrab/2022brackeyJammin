<Vanessa>    You know,\. my dads are a part of the VFD! 

That stands for Volunteer Fire Department. 

After a mysterious fire burned down our neighbor’s house,\. 
they figured the safest place to leave me was here at Hilltop in the snow. 

They even gave me this [rainbow freq=0.2][tornado radius=2 freq=-6]fireman’s badge[/tornado][/rainbow] to keep me safe from fires!
