<Wize old man>  Oh hello! What are you doing here?
	What am I doing here? I live here silly!
	The door? Well everyone knows you shouldn’t open doors in a dream silly!
	Well, actually this is a video game. Who am I talking to? Not you!
	Ok well, I want you to try and imagine something called a [r] button.
	(No not you! Do you see any buttons for you to press?)
	Hitting that should allow you to leave this room and wake from your dream.
